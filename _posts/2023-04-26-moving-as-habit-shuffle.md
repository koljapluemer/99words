title: "Understanding big life changes as a habit shuffle"
---

The next time you or somebody close to you changes apartment, job, or relationship status, take a minute to observe how many habits are newly made but also broken, both big and small.

You neglect to find the nearest store to buy cigarettes, and just like that you stop smoking.
But the same works for running routes.

This is because habits depend on a million little things in your environment and day; change that and they live and die.

Be mindful of that whenever your life changes in a big way.
Use it for good, and mitigate the bad.
