title: "On Fundamental Habits"
---

I want to talk about what I'll call a *Fundamental habit*.


Fundamental habits are the base upon which other habits are built, progress tracked, ideas developed. 


Here are mine: My commonplace book, which holds everything that needs holding. My diary. My productivity system [kaado](https://kaado.koljapluemer.com/) and last my daily check-in call with a friend at 6.30pm.


All share the following properties:


* They are *very* multi-purpose, by design. 
* They are pleasant to do, but no end in themselves. 
* They grow complex, but they can be executed *very* lean on bad days. Say, three words of diary, done. 


And they are *powerful*.
