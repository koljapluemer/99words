Habit building is all about finding *the one habit*.
What if it isn't?

Let's take running. 


What is the one key habit to a successful running habit?
I wouldn't know.


Instead, I would list all the million little things related to running and build conscious check-ins and habits around that. 


Am I still happy with my equipment(every 50 days)? 


Are my running shoes placed visibly (every day)? 


Yesterday, did I make enough time to make a run possible? 


Was I running? 


Why not? 


Don't be afraid of complexity. Just have a good habit tracker that does not frustrate you.
