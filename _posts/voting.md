"I can't start working now, it's already three minutes past the full hour".

"I smoked yesterday, so I may as well smoke today".

Both of these are a form of toxic perfectionism. They are all-or-nothing thinking, incidentally named a [cognitive distortion]().

I want to offer an alternative mental model:

Voting.

[*Voting towards being the kind of person you want to be*](). Not smoking right now is still a vote towards the person you want to be, paying no mind to past nor future. So is working for a lone minute, as opposed to not at all.

Every vote counts.
