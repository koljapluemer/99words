title: "The relevance of a single point of truth in productivity systems"
---


Building a system with a [single point of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth) (SPOT) means that all data within it is only stored in *one* place (in a sense).

It's a relevant term, because every productivity system you will ever build that does not conform to SPOT approach is immediately threatened. 

Examples:

* you have a to-do app, but also occasionally record to-dos on scraps
* you practice Spanish on duolingo but biology with Anki

Quickly, *both* sources of truth will feel incomplete, unsatisfying and sort of useless. Collapse is imminent.

Think about this often and thoroughly, recognize SPOT violations and act quickly.
