[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) sports a feature called [YEAR Reading Challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/show/11633-2023-reading-challenge). You set how many books you intent to read in a given year and it tracks your progress. It's good. However, be aware that it can only work in combination with other habits and systems. How do you find books, when and where do you read, how do you push through boring bits, when do you quit books, and even *when do you update your goodreads*? 

Use, but only as a supplement: Otherwise the challenge will only serve to remind you of what you probably already know. Also don't forget [Goodhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).
