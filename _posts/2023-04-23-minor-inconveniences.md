[Minor inconveniences](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/reitXJgJXFzKpdKyd/beware-trivial-inconveniences) are a most powerful tool to influence behavior, including your own.
Actively build them to rid yourself of behavior you dislike.
To make it work, be mindful of the following rule:

**Removing the inconvenience must be at least as inconvenient as living with it.**


Say your kitchen contains only healthy ingredients and no snacks; that's a good snag in the road to eating unhealthy. 
Yet, if cooking anything tasty takes you 30 minutes and the corner store is only 5 minutes away, it may not be enough.
Find healthy food that's quicker to prepare, or another system.
