> "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"

&mdash; Charles Goodhart

One manifestation of [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) is *hacks*. This effect is abundant in tests: SAT hacks, IELTS hacks, thesis hacks. People optimizing for the test rather than the skill.

Habit tracking of any kind is inherently threatened by this as well.

It's easy to contrive a reason why you deserve that checkmark, filling the rows without filling the *actual* progress bar.

Well-designed habits allow minimal yet meaningful contribution. Nonetheless, you must occasionally check in and ask whether a given habit supports your actual, deep, true goal.
