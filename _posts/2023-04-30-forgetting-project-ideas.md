title: "Noting down project ideas for later"
---


[Cal Newport says](https://calnewport.com/deep-habits-forget-your-project-ideas-until-you-cant-forget-them/) that you should not log your project ideas and instead use salience of recurring thoughts as a beacon towards truly meaningful work.

It's an elegant fix for the threatening idea-hoarding I know too well. 

Yet, it sets forth one assumption I'm less sure about: Our subconscious knows best. Does it? 

I often get obsessed with ideas for random, silly reasons.

Jotting down these ideas breaks the loop, but only if I feel like I am actually storing the idea for good. As such, I may prefer an idea log that I don't look at *too often*.
