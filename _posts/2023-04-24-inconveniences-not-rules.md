Done right, [minor inconveniences](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/reitXJgJXFzKpdKyd/beware-trivial-inconveniences) are [powerful]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2023-04-23-minor-inconveniences.md %}).

However, there is a slippery slope to avoid:
*Instead of a minor inconvenience, why not a major one? Even better, block the behavior entirely?*

Yet, few behaviors in life are purely bad in every context (exceptions like drug abuse require better tools than blogs).
And if you have a legit reason to engage in a "bad" behavior once and it's blocked, you are suddenly incentivized to dismantle the prevention mechanism entirely. 

Whereas you would just suffer the inconvenience this once, your whole habit change is now in danger. 

Avoid that. 
Trust the inconvenience.
