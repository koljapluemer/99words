Years ago, I saw a post of some generic minimalist NYC apartment on some site or other. Someone commented "you need to be very rich to afford this much nothing".

I've wondered ever since: Is minimalism privileged?

I certainly get the sentiment: When your buying power is limited, it's reasonable to buy in bulk, keep spares because you can't just re-buy, and lots of tools to mend other things.

And yet, reading [Walden](), I see Thoreau criticizing people for excessive materialism (BETTER WORD?) who would today be considered radical minimalists.

ENDING?
