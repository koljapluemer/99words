title: "The value of cheap self-help content"
---

Cheap inspirational quotes and generic self-help videos are often ridiculed - rightfully so.

They sell promises they cannot fullfil.
They are used as a vile *just bootstrap yourself* political argument.

Yet on an individual level, they have their use.

Watch any kind of media, and part of your brain starts roleplaying what you see.

Thus, you get a short burst of feeling like a productivity star, and that may genuinely help you. Not for long, not fundamentally, but still. 

If you made a ritual of that, let no one shame you - just know what it is and isn't.
