title: "Tenet and tightly-coupled habits"
---

If you have watched [Tenet](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6723592/), you may have noticed the protagonist doing pull-ups whenever opportunity arises.
The [author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Perrow) of [Normal Accidents](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192408.Normal_Accidents), a book about something else entirely, calls that a *loosely-coupled system*.

Doing pull-ups depends on almost nothing: The environment must offer a somewhat stable bar overhead, and that's it. 

Weather, equipment, occupation or even the flow of space-time are of no interest.


The opposite of that is *tightly-coupled*. 
Many people's exercise regimen are organized like that; dependent on gyms, traffic, motivation, clothing. 


Is yours? 


Does it need to be?


After all, the looks of the protagonist are fine.
